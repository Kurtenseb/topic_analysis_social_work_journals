# Dear Colleagues,

# To run the app, just download the repository and run the R script. It might be necessary to install the packages that are loaded within the script.

# This is a repository that corresponds to an analysis that I have conducted for a research publication titled 'Nature and Extent of Quantitative Research in Social Work Journals: A Systematic Review from 2016 to 2020'
# It is available under: https://academic.oup.com/bjsw/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bjsw/bcab171/6352221?guestAccessKey=3b4442c3-587f-4fc1-9734-8ae125911c6f 
# I also deployed this app on a server that you can access at: https://anonymous-for-peer-review.shinyapps.io/Topics/ 

# Best,
# Sebastian
